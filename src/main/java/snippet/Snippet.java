	🔹 Financial Fraud Rules
	
	Checks based on declared vs actual financial capacity.
	
	Loan-to-Income Ratio > 20 → Loan too large vs income.
	
	Debt-to-Income Ratio > 50% → EMIs consuming half salary.
	
	Salary in payslip ≠ Salary credited in bank → Fake salary slip.
	
	Very low average balance vs high loan → ₹2,000 avg balance, ₹10L loan request.
	
	Frequent cheque bounces in bank statements → Poor repayment capacity.
	
	Cash salary declaration → Unverifiable income.
	
	Unfiled ITR (self-employed claiming high income but no tax record).
	
	Mismatch between ITR and declared salary → Fraudulent income declaration.
	
	Excessive credit card utilization (>80%) → Financial stress.
	
	Multiple active loans (loan stacking fraud).
	
	Short credit history (new applicant, no ITR, no credit card).
	
	⚠️ Fraud Points: +20 to +60
